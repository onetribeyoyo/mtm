  <h2> What is the MTM? </h2>

  <p class="article">The MTM is a multi-dimensional story mapping tool.</p>

  <h2> Why Story Mapping? </h2>

  <div class="light-padding float-right">
    <p class="narrow hint light-padding float-right">Using story maps doesn't get us all the way there either.  To
    truely capture the context it ussually takes some sort of drawing of the system.  Maybe a sketch of the domain
    model; a diagram or two showing how the application will be required to interact with other parts of the ecosystem;
    and so on.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="article">Long lists of stories and backlog items don't cut it.  I want to see at a glance the context of the
  entire project: story maps (and the <g:link action="process">story mapping process</g:link>) are one solution to this
  problem.</p>

  <p class="article">In addition to showing the context, story maps provide a glimpse into the "completeness" of the
  project.  They let us see and share with sponsors what's done, where the problems are, and what's in need of further
  definition.</p>

  <p class="article">And, perhaps most importantly, story maps help us look ahead.  When we're doing iteration planning
  the maps help us see what's coming later so we can make judgement calls on what's best to tackle first &mdash; and we
  can easily do this both from a user's perspective and from a technical complexity/risk perspective.</p>

  <p class="article">In other words, story maps simplify sticking to the S.M.A.R.T. principle...</p>

  </ul>


  <h2> Multi-dimensional Mapping </h2>

  <p class="article">Many development teams use Kanban boards to track work-in-progress, work-on-deck, etc.  This is a
  great approach and many tools are available that automate the low tech "post-its on the wall" technique.  With any
  project the complexity soon passes the point of being able to see it all at a glance.  AND kanban boards are most
  often used to

  <h2> Accuracy and Precision </h2>

  <p class="article">The goal is for absolute accuracy with a moderate level of precision.  At some point the maps will
  represent a summary of the features (both user and technical) of the system.  To this end, the maps need to be
  validated with the team -- at least the most relevant rows.  The rest remains fluid until the project is close to
  completion.</p>

  <p class="article">So by <em>absolute accuracy</em> I mean accurate at a point in time.  There will always be questions
  but when the entire team agrees to the map then the team is also aware of the questions.

  <p class="article">The status reflects the state of the project.  Some stories are in progress, some are done, some
  haven't been started.  Over time the maps show where construction is complete and where portions of the system have
  been tested/accepted.</p>

  <p class="article">Back to accuracy: The story maps will be accurate, but the precision (the detail) will be in the
  stories and tasks in jira.  So as we are planning iterations we'll be guided by the high-er level priorities shown in
  the story map and make sure we drive out the details in jira to represent the work we are doing to get everything
  done.</p>


  <h2> Why is it called &ldquo;MTM&rdquo;? </h2>

  <p class="article">MTM &equiv; Magic Task Machine.  It's called the magic task machine 'cause I like the way it sounds
  and it reminds me of the <a href="http://www.musanim.com/">music animation machine</a>.</p>


  <h2> How did this all start? </h2>

  <p class="article">Sometime back in the 1900s I saw Edward Tufte speak.  Part of his presentation/show was the
  <a href="http://www.musanim.com/">music animation machine</a> and that got me thinking about better ways to show scope
  and progress.</p>

  <p class="article">The first version of MTM was based on strategic planning work facilitated by Arleta Little for the
  now defunct Dwelling In The Woods retreat center.  We were both on the board at the time and Arleta's process lead
  directly to the multi-dimensional nature of my story maps.</p>

  <p class="article">First use of the MTM was to plan a fireplace renovation project.  The project turned out to be
  bigger and more difficult than I envisioned so I decided to spend my time futzing with MTM instead.  Since then I've
  used MTM personally and professionaly on a large number of projects.</p>

  <p class="article">MTM was open sourced in 2013.</p>

  <p class="article">mille meae Siculis errant in montibus agnae; lac mihi non aestate novum, non frigore defit; canto
  quae solitus, si quando armenta vocabat, Amphion Dircaeus in Actaeo Aracimtho. Nec sum adeo informis: nuper me in
  litore vidi, cum placidum ventis staret mare; non ego Daphnim iudice te metuam, si numquam fallit imago.</p>

  <p class="article">O tantum libeat mecum tibi sordida rura atque humilis habitare casas, et figere cervos, haedorumque
  gregem viridi compellere hibisco! Mecum una in silvis imitabere Pana canendo. Pan primus calamos cera coniungere
  pluris instituit; Pan curat ovis oviumque magistros.</p>

  <p class="article">Nec te paeniteat calamo trivisse labellum: haec eadem ut sciret, quid non faciebat Amyntas? est
  mihi disparibus septem compacta cicutis fistula, Damoetas dono mihi quam dedit olim, et dixit moriens: `Te nunc habet
  ista secundum.' dixit Damoetas, invidit stultus Amyntas.</p>

  <p class="article">Praeterea duo, nec tuta mihi valle reperti, capreoli, sparsis etiam nunc pellibus albo, bina die
  siccant ovis ubera; quos tibi servo: iam pridem a me illos abducere Thestylis orat; et faciet, quoniam sordent tibi
  munera nostra. Huc ades, O formose puer: tibi lilia plenis ecce ferunt Nymphae calathis; tibi candida Nais, pallelltis
  violas et summa papavera carpens, narcissum et florem iungit bene olentis anethi; tum casia atque aliis intexens
  suavibus herbis, mollia luteola pingit vaccinia calta.</p>

  <p class="article">Ipse ego cana legam tenera lanugine mala, castaneasque nuces, mea quas Amaryllis amabat; addam
  cerea pruna: honos erit huic quoque pomo; et vos, O lauri, carpam, et te, proxima myrte, sic positae quoniam suavis
  miscetis odores. </p>
